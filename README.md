Features
Kidney Disease Prediction: The system employs machine learning algorithms to predict kidney diseases based on various patient parameters such as age, blood pressure, albumin levels, glucose levels, etc.

Data Collection: The system integrates with IoMT devices to collect real-time patient data such as blood pressure, glucose levels, and other relevant health parameters.

Dashboard: A user-friendly dashboard is provided to visualize patient data, including historical trends and alerts for abnormal readings.

Patient Management: The system allows healthcare professionals to manage patient profiles, view medical history, and track the progress of kidney disease treatments.

Alerts and Notifications: The system can generate alerts and notifications for healthcare professionals when patient data falls outside normal ranges or when there is a need for immediate attention.

Data Analytics: The collected data can be analyzed to gain insights into trends, patterns, and potential risk factors related to kidney diseases.
